# Piccolo Cipher Implementation in VHDL

This VHDL project implements the Piccolo cryptographic algorithm, a lightweight block cipher designed for constrained environments.
C code in file "checking_with_c" from repository https://github.com/Daeinar/piccolo.git is used for testing and validating the VHDL implementation. 

The project follows the specifications outlined in the paper Piccolo: A Lightweight Block Cipher, aiming to provide efficient hardware-based encryption using the Piccolo algorithm.
